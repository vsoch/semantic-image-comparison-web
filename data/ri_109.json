    "description": "Contrast between trials preceding cashout trials and trials preceding pump trials in the BART (trials matched for level of risk)\r\n\r\nThis contrast is contrasting trials immediately preceding a cashout vs. trials immediately preceding a pump. However, the pre-pump condition only contains a subset of all the pre-pump trials for that participant that are matched to the risk level of that participant's pre-cashout trials. So both the pre-pump and pre-cashout regressor would include 3 trials from pump #3, 5 trials from pump #4, 2 trials from pump #5, and so on.",
